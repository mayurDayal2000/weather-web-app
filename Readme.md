<h1>Weather Forecaster App</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Weather App is a simple, interative and responsive web application where a user can search any city name
and get the weather report rendered on the page.
</p>

<p>
The accuweather api is used to fetch the location name and the weather conditions of a the location name. One limitation is 
that I am using the trial version of the api so the api request is limited. To fetch the data, I have used the fetch with async and await. 
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
First enter the city name, you want to search in the input field. The weather info will be rendered with the following details:
<ul>
    <li>check if the location has day or night time</li>
    <li>get the current weather icon with text</li>
    <li>get the current temperature based on your searched location</li>
    <li>get the detail location name</li>
</ul>
